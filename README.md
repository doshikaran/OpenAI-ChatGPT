ChatGPT: OptimizingLanguage Models for Dialogue
Weâ€™ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. 
The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject 
inappropriate requests. ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.
